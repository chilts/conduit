CGI-Conduit - v0.01
===================

Base class for nice CGI::Fast web applications.

This module allows you to setup a number of parts of your web application using
only a config file. This includes things like connections to your database,
memcache servers, redis, use of Template::Toolkit, and finally cookie and
session dealings.

Many things are 'baked' in at the moment (ie. the things I like) but am ready
to split these off into separate roles so things can be mixed and matched.

	perl Makefile.PL
